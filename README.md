# CS_MovementGod

This script combines the "Null Movement script" with the "Snap Tap" feature for smoother keyboard controls in games like CS2. It also includes my own Auto-CounterStrafe Feature, similar to DKS in Wooting keyboards, automating Counter Strafing without requiring user mastery.

Using macros in online games can lead to bans, so use this script at your own risk.

Note: This script may consume significant system resources due to frequent keystroke checks. Avoid use if stability is a concern.
